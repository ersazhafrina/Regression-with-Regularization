# Regression-with-Regularization
This project was made to complete an assignment from the bootcamp that I followed

In this project, using the Regularization in Linear Regression method to make sure the model that used are not underfitting or overfitting. If the result is underfitting, it means the model are too simple for this dataset. In the other side, if the result is overfitting, it means the model are too complicated for this dataset. 

The explanation of each step is in the attached source code
